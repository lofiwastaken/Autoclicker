# Info


Hello! This is my first Github post as well as my first piece of coding. If you have any suggestions please make sure to leave a comment as it helps me in the future. This piece of coding is not only meant for games but for other uses, I do not have or take any responsibility if you get banned or in trouble for the use of my code. I will be uploading a video or uploaded a video depending on the time you read this. I will also provide the download link in another comment there may or may not be a verification tab but there should always be a skip button. If you think that the directions are not self explanatory you should check out the video I will post or posted on my channel. Again I take no responsibility in the case you get in trouble or banned in a game or in a website. Thank you for your time and I hope you enjoy this software
